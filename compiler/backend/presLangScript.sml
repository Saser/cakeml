(* PresLang intends to be a generalization of multiple languages. The purpose is
* * to do most of the JSON-work in a to_JSON in PresLang instead of having each language have it's own.
* * It is unclear how many languages we can include in PresLang, but the current
* * assumption is that at least all non-imperative languages will be included.
* * The imperative languages might get something similar to PresLang to represent
* * a generalization of them. *)
